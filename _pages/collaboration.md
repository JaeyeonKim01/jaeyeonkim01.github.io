I have been fortunate to work with many talented junior collaborators and mentees, and I have learned a great deal from them! Some notable collaborators include:

- [Kiwhan Song](https://kiwhan.dev/) (OpenAI): 2025, diffusion models.
- [Junsu Kim](https://junsukim.notion.site/) (Student Researcher at Google Deepmind): 2025, convergence analysis for LoRA.
- [Brian Lee](https://brianlck.github.io/) (Jane Street): 2025, flexible-length discrete diffusions.
- [Seunggeun Kim](https://seunggeunkimkr.github.io/) and [Taekyun Lee](https://taekyunl.github.io/) (UT Austin): 2025 --, inference-time algorithms for discrete diffusions.
- [Jonathan Geuter](https://j-geuter.github.io/) (Harvard): 2025 --, discrete diffusion model training.
- Sunwoo Kim (SNU): 2026 --.
- Ulrik Unneberg (Harvard): 2026 --, multimodal generative models.
- Yuyuan Chen (Harvard): 2026 --, reinforcement learning for generative models.
- Woosang Jeon (SNU): 2026 --, reinforcement learning for generative models.
- Woobin Park (SNU): 2026 --, diffusion model training.
- Pranav Sitaraman and Gavin Ye (Harvard College): 2026 --, diffusion model inference.

These collaborations have taken the form of either close research effort or mentoring-oriented. In all cases, I aim to stay deeply involved in each project, at a co-first-author level of contribution! At the moment, due to limited capacity, I do not have dedicated mentoring spots available until Summer 2026.
